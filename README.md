* Lab01, Lab02 : RCA is limited to 4 bits because it applies carry to the next calculation, which slows down the process. Calculations beyond 4 bits are performed using CLA.

* Lab03, Lab04 : In Lab03, the Subtractor is a basic 16-bit subtractor using 2's complement. In Lab04, the Subtractor is designed using gate-level design by employing instances of Half-Subtractor, Full-Subtractor, and each higher-level module.
